Title: Recursive Quoted Language Expansion
Description: Expands quoted language by recursively replacing any symbol that
    points to quoted language with the language it points to.  The recursive
    process continues until only symbols that point to non-language objects
    remain.  The resulting quoted language can then be evaluated normally.  This
    differs from the traditional 'quote'/'eval' pattern because it resolves
    intermediate language objects that would interfere with evaluation.
